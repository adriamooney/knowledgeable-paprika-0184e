          > "It's chaos, and make no mistake, for the universe is just being
          born. It's the great becoming that makes the light and the heat and
          the motion, and bangs you from hither to yon." ~**Winston Niles
          Rumford**


          > "We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by
          mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn." ~
          **Henry D. Thoreau**
